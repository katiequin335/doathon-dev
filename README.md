# doathon development site

Hi! *waves*. If you're here looking for the OpenCon Doathon area we're afraid you took a wrong turn. This is [here](https://github.com/sparcopen/doathon). In this repo we code up the site that powers it in a place that we can mess up without causing problems and talk about other tech in issues.

If that sounds like what you're after though... then welcome, nice of you to join us. Take a peak at our contributing guide or issues for how to get involved.
